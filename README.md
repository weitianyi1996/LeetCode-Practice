# LeetCode-Practice
I keep my Python Code on practicing LeetCode algorithm problems here.
Each week supposed to finish 5 questions. 
Sorry, I do not keep this practice notebook looks neat. I do those great questions maybe two times or three times. So here you probably may see me struggling with my 'ugly and slow' solutions at my very first try.
While as an aspring Data Scientist, I wish to practice my coding skill very hard and keep moving and practicing all the time!!!
